\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document illustrates how to process large images (about 10 Gigabytes in
size) by taking advantage of the streaming capabilities of the Insight Toolkit
ITK.  Here we illustrate two scenarios: (a) the case when the image itself is
larger than the computer's RAM, (b) the case when the image is large but still
can fit in the computer's RAM. This report is intended to serve as a tutorial
on how to take advantage of this memory management capabilities of ITK.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that we used for validating the algorithm described in this paper.
This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific publications must
facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

Large images are becoming ubiquitus in many research fields. They are
particularly common in microscopy, remote sensing and computer vision.  Image
sizes are growing at a higher rate than the size of computer memory and
therefore there is a great interest in software method that allow to process
images by partitioning in pieces that can temporarily be fit into memory.

In this technical report we illustrate how this can be done with the current
infrastructure of the Insight Toolkit (ITK).
