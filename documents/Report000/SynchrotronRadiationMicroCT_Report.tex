\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This paper describes two MicroCT datasets that Creatis has made publicly
available to the imaging community. These datasets were acquired using
Synchrotron Radiation, have resolutions of 1.4 microns, and size in the range of
six GigaBytes.

This paper is a pure data contribution. The datasets described here have been
made available in the public MIDAS database. Here we describe the content of
the files to make easier for others to use this data as input for their own
research work.  This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific
publications must facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.

\section{Introduction}

The concept of bone quality is increasingly considered to be an important factor
to explain bone fragility in addition to bone mass. Studies on trabecular 
bone allow analysis of microarchitecture simultaneously with bone-damaging
processes, since the localization, orientation and shape of trabeculae strongly
affect the characteristics and nature of this damage.

While, contrast agents are being developed for 3D observations with standard
micro-CT device, the spatial resolution of these images and the capacity of
contrast agents to specifically bind to microcracks are still not sufficient
to provide relevant 3D data on microcrack morphology. On the other hand,
Synchrotron Radiation Micro-Computerized Tomography (SR $\mu$-CT) possesses
significant advantages over standard micro-CT.

The datasets we are here introducing made part of a study in order to develop 
 new 3D imaging methods based on SR $\mu$-CT images to analyze physiological
microcracks in human trabecular bone at the micrometric scale. The precision
of SR $\mu$-CT and combined with image processing techniques allow to study
 the actual morphology of microcracks. For further details on the developed
methodology, we refer the reader to~\cite{Larrue2011}. 

\section{Acquisition Process}
\subsection{Sample Preparation}
Femoral head trabecular bone compartments were obtained from patients undergoing  
total hip replacement for osteoarthritis. 

Sample preparation was performed following the guidelines from \cite{Davies2006}. 
Cylinders, 10 mm diameter, were drilled with a diamond threphine from the original 
slices and cut to a height of 5 mm using a Leica SP1600 Saw microtome. During the 
cutting procedure, the bone was irrigated with sterile 0.9\% sodium chloride at 
4\textcelsius  %Do you know how to fix this?
 to limit the-gnerated damage, remove bone chips, and prevent drying.
Next, bone cores were embedded in methylmethacrylate. Finally, pseudo-parallelepiped 
samples (5x5x10mm) were prepared for SR $\mu$-CT imaging.  

\subsection{Imaging}
Images were acquired on the SR $\mu$-CT setup developed on beamline ID19 at 
the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France~\cite{Weitkamp2010}. 
Samples were attached on stands adapted to the rotation stage and were placed as 
close as possible to the camera to limit phase contrast.  

Further details on the whole acquisition protocol can be found in \cite{Larrue2011}. 

\section{Datasets Location}

The datasets are in the MIDAS Database:
\url{http://www.insight-journal.org/midas/community/view/33}

and have the unique identifier:

\section{Dataset 1}


This dataset is named

\begin{itemize}
\item hunc34\_14\_a\_float.mhd
\item hunc34\_14\_a\_float.raw
\end{itemize}

Its identifier in MIDAS is

This dataset represents the original data that is obtained after tomographic
reconstruction. Its size around 22 Gb. Table~\ref{table:summary} summarizes
the principal acquisition parameters of this particular dataset.

\end{table} 

\section{Dataset 2}

This dataset is named

\begin{itemize}
\item hunc34\_14\_a.mhd
\item hunc34\_14\_a.raw
\end{itemize}

Its identifier in MIDAS is

% FIXME
\url{http://hdl.handle.net/1926/1750}

The dataset is the result of scaling the original float image (32 bits per pixel)
to an image with an unsigned char pixel type (8 bits per pixel). The latter
reduces the image size to approximately 6 Gb.
