\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This paper describes three MicroCT datasets that Creatis has made publicly
available to the imaging community. These datasets were acquired using
synchrotron radiation, have resolutions of x microns, and size in the range of
six GigaBytes.

This paper is a pure data contribution. The datasets described here have been
made available in the public MIDAS database. Here we describe the content of
the files to make easier for others to use this data as input for their own
research work.  This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific
publications must facilitate \textbf{reproducibility} of the reported results.
